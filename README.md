# Grid & Flexbox Responsive Layout

This project is a responsive web layout built using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**, focusing on modern layout techniques and adaptive design principles.

The layout is based on a multi-column **CSS Grid** structure for desktop screens and transitions to a **single-column layout** for smaller screens using media queries. Flexbox is used inside individual grid items to align and distribute content.

The focus of the project is on layout techniques, including grid positioning, flex alignment, and responsive behavior.  
Images and content adjust smoothly across screen sizes to improve readability and usability on mobile devices.
